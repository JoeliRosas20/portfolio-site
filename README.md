<h2>NavBar</h2>
Features of the NavBar.

- The Link tag is from the ReactRouter library. 

- One of the features of Link is the "to." It leads to a file once a certain action occurs. 

- It has the “onClick” attribute. It invokes a function so it can do something.

- There is the state of click. It has click and setClick. SetClick changes the logo from 'x' to the three bars. Also it shows the menu and hides it.

- The handleClick function switches the icon logo from 'x' to three bars. The closeMobileMenu function closes the menu once the link is clicked.

- The className change happens where if click is true, it will display the first option (display the x and show the menu). If it is false, it will display the second option (the bars and not show the menu).
